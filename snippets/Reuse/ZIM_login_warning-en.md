- You can custom the **userID** and **userName**, and we recommend you set the  **userID** to a meaningful value and associate them with the account system of your application.
- For SDK 2.3.0 or later: The SDK uses the AppSign authentication mode by default. You only need to pass the [`ZIMUserInfo`\|_blank](@-ZIMUserInfo) when logging in. 

- If you use the Token-based authentication mode, please refer to the [Authentication\|_blank](!token_authentication/token_authentication) to get the Token first, and pass it when logging in.
