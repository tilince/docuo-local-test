On a game UI, buttons and panels, such as **Settings**, **Close**, and **Description**, are UI components of the game. You can adjust these components. For example, if you do not allow players to close a game by using the **Close** button on the game UI, you can call the corresponding API operation to hide the **Close** button component. Then, you can design a unified **Close** button and call the corresponding API operation to close the game. This ensures consistency of the UI logic.

The supported UI components and component adjustment methods vary based on the game. Therefore, you need to obtain the list of game components before you adjust the components.
