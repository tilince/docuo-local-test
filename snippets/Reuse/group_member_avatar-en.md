<div class="mk-hint">

As of the current version, when this interface is called for the first time to pull the list of group members, the avatars of group members can be retrieved. If you call this interface again, you can get the avatar information of new users, but the avatar information of existing users will not be updated.

To get the latest avatars of group members, please call the interface [queryGroupMemberInfo\|_blank](@queryGroupMemberList) <a href="#queryGroupMemberInfo">to query group member info</a>.
