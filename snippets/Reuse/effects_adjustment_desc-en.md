A game can use the following notification effects:

- Music: the sound that plays on a loop during gaming, typically the background music of the game.
- Sound effects: the sounds that briefly play during gaming, such as the deal sound and applause.
- Vibration: the vibration effect.

The preceding notification effects can be adjusted by using the following two methods:

- Adjust the notification effects on the game UI. During gaming, players can adjust the preceding notification effects on the game UI. For example, players can turn off the music, sound effects, and vibration mode to create a quiet environment.
- Call API operations of ZEGO MiniGameEngine SDK to adjust the notification effects. The business side can adjust volumes based on the gaming scenario. For example, when a user plays a game in the game center, your application can turn on the music and sound effects by default. When a user is in a voice chatroom or needs to turn on the microphone, your application can turn off the music and sound effects or turn down the volumes by default.

This topic describes how to adjust the music, sound effects, and vibration settings by calling API operations of ZEGO MiniGameEngine SDK.
