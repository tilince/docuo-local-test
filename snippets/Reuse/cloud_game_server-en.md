For more information about how to connect to the ZEGO MiniGameEngine server, see [Server API - Make API requests\|\_blank](#17807). For more information about how to obtain a game start code, see [Obtain a game start code\|\_blank](!ZegoMiniGameEngine-Get_Activation_Code). This way, the host can obtain the game start code before the host <a href="#startCloudGame">starts the live comment-based game</a>. ZEGO provides [sample server code\|\_blank](!ZegoMiniGameEngine-download) for your reference. For your data security, do not use the sample server code in a production environment.
