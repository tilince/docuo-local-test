- The Super Board SDK needs to be used together with the ZegoExpress-Video SDK (whiteboard feature included), which provides real-time signaling transmission capabilities.
- The ZegoExpress-Video SDK (whiteboard feature included) has been included in the SDK package you downloaded from this page. You do not need to download it separately.
- If you have integrated the ZegoExpress-Video SDK, you will need to delete the old SDK package you have downloaded and re-integrate the SDK obtained from this page to avoid the initialization failure caused by the SDK version mismatch.
- Sample app: For the sample app and how to run the sample code, see [Sample app\|_blank](!sample_app).
- SDK integration: To integrate the SDK and getting started, see [Getting started\|_blank](!QuickStart/CreateWboard).
