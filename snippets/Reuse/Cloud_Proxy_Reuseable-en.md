## Overview

With the cloud proxy feature, you can transfer all the traffic from SDK through the cloud proxy server for RTC communication by setting the SDK's cloud proxy API method. 

This feature is suitable for you to use public RTC services when you are in an intranet-limited network environment, such as hospitals, governmental institutions, enterprises, etc.

"Cloud Proxy" is a `paid` feature. If you need to use this feature, please contact ZEGO sales staff for consultation.
