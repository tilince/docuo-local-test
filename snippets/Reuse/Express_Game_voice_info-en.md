### 1.1 Basic concepts

- Sphere: An area for audio reception.
- Position: The coordinates of a listener in the game. For more information, see section "5.5 Set the position of a listener".
- Listener: The user who receives audio in a room.
- Speaker: The user who sends audio in a room.

### 1.2 Description

ZEGO Express SDK **2.11.0** and later support the in-game voice chat service, which includes the sphere-specific audio, 3D sound effects, and team voice chat features.

<td>Sphere-specific audio</td>
<td><p>Only sounds within a specified sphere can be heard by listeners in a room. To ensure sound quality, listeners can hear up to 20 speakers nearest to them.</p>
<p>Assume that the maximum radius of the sphere is R, and the distance between the speaker and listener is r:</p>
<ul><li>If r < R, the speaker is within the sphere and can be heard. </li><li>If r â‰¥ R, the speaker is out of the sphere and cannot be heard.</li></ul>

### 1.3 Applicable scenarios

In-game voice chat is applicable to scenarios such as online multiplayer video games and metaverse applications.

In the former scenario, players can change their team before and after a session starts, which means you can implement team voice without configuring stream grouping or publishing and playing.

In both scenarios, the 3D sound effects can be applied to simulate sound directions and distances, making the scenes more realistic.
