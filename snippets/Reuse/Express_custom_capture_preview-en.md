<div class="mk-warning">

During the video capturing process, if you sent the encoded video frame data via the [`sendCustomVideoCaptureEncodedData`\|_blank](@sendCustomVideoCaptureEncodedData) method to the SDK, the SDK will not be able to preview. That is, at this point, you will need to set up the preview yourself.
