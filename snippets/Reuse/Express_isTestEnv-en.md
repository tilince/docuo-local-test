<div class = 'mk-hint'>

- The AppID you get from the ZEGO Admin Console is by default for use in the testing environment. When you initialize the SDK in the development and testing phase, you need to configure the SDK to use the testing environment. Otherwise, the initialization will fail. **Before your project goes live, you need to contact ZEGO sales for setting up the production environment in advance.**
- If you set the `isTestEnv`Â parameter to `true`, the SDK uses the testing environment. If you set it to `false`, the SDK uses the production environment.
