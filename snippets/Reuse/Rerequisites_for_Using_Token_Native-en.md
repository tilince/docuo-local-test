Before you start to implement user privilege authentication in your app, make sure you complete the following steps:

1. If you need the Room ID and Published stream ID authentication feature, contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable it. 

2. Integrate the ZEGO Express SDK (version 2.17.0 or later) into your project and implement the basic audio and video features. For details, see [Getting started - Integration\|_blank](!ExpressVideoSDK-Integration/SDK_Integration) and [Getting started - Implementation\|_blank](!ExpressVideoSDK-Integration/Solution_Implementation).
