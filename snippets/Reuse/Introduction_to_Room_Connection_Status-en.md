Before a user uses ZEGOCLOUD Express SDK to make audio and video calls or perform live streaming, the user must join a room to receive callback notifications about events such as adding or removing streams by other users in the same room, and user login and logout events. Therefore, a connection state of a user in the room determines whether the user can normally use the audio and video services.

This topic describes how to determine a connection state of a user in a room. Further, this topic describes the transition process of connection states.
