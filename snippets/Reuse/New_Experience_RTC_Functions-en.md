Run your project on a real device. Upon successful running, you can view the local video.

For your convenience of experience, ZEGOCLOUD provides a [Debugging example for the web platform\|_blank](https://zegodev.gitee.io/zego-express-webrtc-sample/assistDev/index.html?lang=en). On the debugging page, you can enter the AppID and room ID of the real device user, and a different user ID to log in to the same room for communicating with the real device user. After a video call starts successfully, you can hear the remote audio and view the remote video.
