In this case, after the ZEGO Real-Time Audio and Video Cloud received the streams published by the host and the guest host, with the stream mixing service, it will only output a single H.265 mixed stream, and then this stream will be published to the CDN for transcoding.

For the audience, they can choose to play the H.265 or H.264 stream from the CDN according to the H.265 video encoding ability of their devices.
