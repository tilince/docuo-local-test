ZEGOCLOUD supports setting up the video configuration during a real-time video call or live streaming, such as video capture and video encoding output resolution, video frame rate, bitrate, view mode, and mirror mode.

Setting the proper video resolution, frame rate, and bitrate to provide a better experience in audio and video scenarios. 
Setting the appropriate view modes to provide a personalized video display mode.

**Basic concepts**

- Resolution:
    - Video resolution: The number of pixels contained in each frame. The video resolution is often expressed in PPI.
    - Capture resolution: The total amount of pixels captured by a camera. 
    - Encoder resolution: The resolution of the encoded image.
- Bitrate (bps): The number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time. The bitrate is expressed in the unit bit per second unit. 
- Frame rate (fps): The frequency (rate) at which consecutive images (frames) are captured or displayed. The frame rate is often expressed in frames per second or fps.
