#### What is the difference between stream mixing and single stream transcoding?

Stream mixing is generally used to merge multiple input streams into one, and it supports defining the encoding format, resolution, and other parameters of multiple output streams. Stream mixing and transcoding require developers to call client or server APIs to trigger the process.

Single stream transcoding of a single stream is used to achieve the transcoding function of a single stream, and it does not require additional calls to client or server APIs to trigger the process. Simply include the template parameter when pulling the stream to trigger it.
