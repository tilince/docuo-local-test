After initializing the face beautification environment, you can call the [`setEffectsBeautyParam`\|_blank](@setEffectsBeautyParam) method to set the intensity as needed **after or before the stream publishing**.

- smoothIntensity: Skin smoothing. Smooth the skin while preserving details of the face, such as moles.
- whitenIntensity: Skin tone enhancement. Turn up the overall brightness to whiten your face.
- rosyIntensity: Cheek blusher. Carry on the warm color processing to the whole picture.
- sharpenIntensity: Image sharpening. You can sharpen it slightly to make it clearer when the picture is a little blurry.


The value range for the four features is [0, 100], and the default value is 50. As this value gets larger, the intensity gets stronger.
