Pinning conversations refers to fixing one-on-one or group chat conversations at the top of the conversation list, preventing them from being pushed to the bottom by other non-pinned conversations, and making it easier for users to find them. When users pin a conversation through the client, the pinned status is stored on the server. Therefore, when users switch to another device, the pinned status will be synchronized to the current device.
