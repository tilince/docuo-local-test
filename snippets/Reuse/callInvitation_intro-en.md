In common mode, a user can initiate, cancel, accept, and reject a call invitation, and does not respond to a call invitation within the specified timeout period. On this basis, in advanced mode, a user can invite a new user during the call, and quit and terminate the call.

The call invitation feature provides only basic capabilities for service procedure control. The service requirements for using this feature must be manually implemented. For example, the feature is commonly used in a chat tool for initiating a voice call invitation or a video call invitation.
