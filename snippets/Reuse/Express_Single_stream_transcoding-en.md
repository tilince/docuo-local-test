Single stream transcoding refers to converting a single original stream into transcoded streams with different encoding formats and resolutions in the cloud. In live streaming scenarios, viewers can choose different resolution streams to watch based on their network quality and terminal devices to ensure smooth playback. 


### Application scenarios

- When you provide multiple resolution video streams for users to watch on demand, you need to convert the original stream into transcoded streams with different clarity levels. In this case, you can use the single stream transcoding function.
- When converting the original video stream into different video encoding formats, you can use the single stream transcoding function. For example, some devices cannot decode H.265 due to performance issues, and need to be transcoded to H.264.
