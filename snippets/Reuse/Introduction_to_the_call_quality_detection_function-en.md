During the process of making video calls using the ZEGOCLOUD Express SDK, users may sometimes encounter poor network conditions. In this case, you can use relevant callbacks to understand the current network quality and changes in video information during the call.

For example, when conducting multi-party video calls or singing sessions, we need to display the users' network quality in real-time. You can refer to this document to implement the corresponding functionality.
