## Introduction

This guide describes how to implement basic audio and video functions with the ZEGO Express SDK.

Basic concepts:

- ZEGO Express SDK: The real-time audio and video SDK developed by ZEGO to help you quickly build high-quality, low-latency, and smooth real-time audio and video communications into your apps across different platforms, with support for massive concurrency.
- Stream publishing: The process of the client app capturing and transmitting audio and video streams to the ZEGO Real-Time Audio and Video Cloud.
- Stream playing: The process of the client app receiving and playing audio and video streams from the ZEGO Real-Time Audio and Video Cloud.
- Room: The service for organizing groups of users, allowing users in the same room to send and receive real-time audio, video, and messages to each other.

    1. Logging in to a room is required to perform stream publishing and playing.
    2. Users can only receive notifications about changes in the room they are in (such as new users joining the room, existing users leaving the room, new audio and video streams being published, etc.).
