Multi-source data collection is used to manage the configuration of audio and video sources for various channels. With this capability, you can achieve real-time interaction of different audio and video content, such as screen sharing and audio mixing.

The main features and limitations of multi-source data collection are as follows:
- The streaming channels support multiple types of audio and video sources, but each source can only be occupied by one channel.
- The main channel supports dynamic switching of audio and video sources and also supports audio mixing. The auxiliary channel only supports specifying the capture source before streaming and does not support audio mixing.
- The video and audio for screen recording must be in the same channel.
