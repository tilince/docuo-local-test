Custom video pre-processing refers to processing the captured video with the AI Effects SDK for features such as face beautification, and stickers, this might be needed when the Video Call SDK does not meet your development requirements.

Compared to the custom video capture feature, 
the custom video pre-processing does not require you to manage the device input sources, you only need to manipulate the raw data thrown out by the `ZegoExpress-Video SDK`, and then send it back to the `ZegoExpress-Video SDK`.
