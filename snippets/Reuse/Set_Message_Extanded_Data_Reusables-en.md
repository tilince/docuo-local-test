ZEGOCLOUD Instant Messaging (ZIM) SDK allows you to add an extension field to a message and send the extension field as additional message information. Message extension fields can be visible to the peer end or visible only to the local end based on the synchronization effects. A message extension field is used to present information such as the translation status and translation content of a message, and the business logic included in the message.
