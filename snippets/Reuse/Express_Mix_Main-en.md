## 4 Basic process

The following describes the basic process of stream mixing: 

1. In-room users publish stream A and stream B to the ZEGO Real-Time Audio and Video Cloud.
2. The ZEGO Real-Time Audio and Video server publish the mixed stream (A + B) or publish stream A and B separately to the CDN based on the actual situations. (Using the RTMP protocol)
3. The stream player side plays the mixed stream (A + B) or plays stream A and B separately based on the actual needs. (Supports RTMP, FLV, HLS protocols.)
