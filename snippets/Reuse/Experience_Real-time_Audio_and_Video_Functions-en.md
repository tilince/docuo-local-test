We recommend you run your project on a real device. If your app runs successfully, you should hear the sound and see the video captured locally from your device. 

To test out the real-time audio and video features, visit the [ZEGO Express Web Demo\|_blank](https://zegodev.github.io/zego-express-webrtc-sample/assistDev/index.html) (only supported in the test environment), and enter the same `AppID` and `RoomID` to join the same room. If it runs successfully, you should be able to view the video from both the local side and the remote side, and hear the sound from both sides as well.

In audio-only scenarios, no video will be captured and displayed.
