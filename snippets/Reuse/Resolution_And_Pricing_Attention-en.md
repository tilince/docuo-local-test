**Resolution And Pricing Attention!**

Please pay close attention to the relationship between **video resolution and price** when implementing video call, live streaming, and other video scenarios.


**When playing multiple video streams in the same room, the billing will be based on the sum of the resolutions, and different resolutions will correspond to different billing tiers.**


The video streams that are included in the calculation of the final resolution are as follows:

1. Live streaming video view (such as host view, co-host view, PKBattle view, etc.)
2. Video call's video view for each person
3. Screen sharing view
4. Resolution of the cloud recording service
5. Resolution of the Live stream creation

Before your app goes live, please **make sure you have reviewed all configurations and confirmed the billing tiers** for your business scenario to avoid unnecessary losses. For more details, please refer to [Pricing\|_blank](https://www.zegocloud.com/pricing).
