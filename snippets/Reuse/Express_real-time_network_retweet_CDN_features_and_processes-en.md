This use case has the following two features:

- The host forwards the streams that are published to the ZEGO Real-Time Audio and Video Cloud to the CDN for transcoding, and the audience can decide to play H.265 mixed stream or H.264 mixed stream based on the H.265 decoding ability of the devices.

- The guest host can play the streams directly from the ZEGO Real-Time Audio and Video Cloud when the host publishes his stream to the Cloud for interactive communication, but this also requires the device the guest host using to support the H.265 decoding ability.
