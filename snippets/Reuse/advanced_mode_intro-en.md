You can initiate a call invitation in advanced mode in a call invitation scenario involving a plurality of users, such as a multi-invitee call invitation scenario.

After a call invitation is initiated in advanced mode, the lifecycle of the call invitation ends when a user calls the [callEnd\|\_blank](@callEnd) operation to terminate the call. Before the call is terminated, a user in the call can invite a new user or quit the call.
