<div class="mk-warning">

The sample server code cannot be used in a production environment for data security. ZEGO is not liable for any risks or losses that are caused if you use the sample server code in a production environment.

</div>

### Prepare the environment

Before you run the sample server code for Node.js, make sure that the development environment meets the following requirements:

- Node.js is installed.
- A computer that runs Windows or macOS is connected to the internet.

### Prerequisites

- A project is created in the [ZEGO console\|_blank](https://console.zegocloud.com). The values of the `AppID` and `ServerSecret` parameters of the project are obtained. For more information, see [How to view project information\|_blank](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/admin-console/view-project-information).
- The mini-game service is activated by contacting ZEGO business staff.
- The sample server code is obtained. For more information, see [Download\|_blank](!ZegoMiniGameEngine-download).

### Directory structure of the sample code

The following section describes the directory structure of the sample server code. All file paths involved in this topic are based on the directory structure.

```tree
ZegoMiniGameServerDemo
├── index.js        # The main file.
├── package.json    # The configuration file.
└── utils
    ├── config.js    # Enter the values of the `AppID` and `ServerSecret` parameters that you obtain in the ZEGO console.
    ├── gameToken.js # The token generated by the server. 
    └── getToken04.js 
```

### Run the sample code

1. Decompress the `ZegoMiniGameServerDemo.zip` package of the sample server code to obtain the `ZegoMiniGameServerDemo` folder.

2. Modify the `ZegoMiniGameServerDemo/utils/config.js` file by specifying the `appID` parameter in the red-framed part as shown in the following figure.

Fill in the appId requested from the ZEGO console

Fill in the serverSecret  requested from the ZEGO console

<div class="mk-warning">

The `https://mini-game-api.zego.im` host address provided in this file is the endpoint of the mini-game server and cannot be modified.

</div>

4. Go to the `ZegoMiniGameServerDemo` folder and run the following code on the terminal to start the mini-game server:
   
   ```
   npm i # Install dependencies.
   node index.js
   ```

5. Obtain the server address, which can be used as the <a href="#host_ip">backend address in the sample client code</a>.
   
   The following figure shows the output after the sample server code is run.
