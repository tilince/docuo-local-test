ZEGO Express SDK provides monitoring (in-ear monitoring) and stereo channel functionality. You can set it as needed.

- Monitoring allows you to listen to the microphone input from the device through headphones (wired or Bluetooth) when they are plugged into the device.
- Stereo channel refers to having two audio channels. By detecting the phase difference between the left and right ears when listening to sound, you can determine the specific position of the sound source. By default, ZEGO Express SDK captures audio in mono. However, when you have a high audio quality requirement, you can enable stereo channel capture. With dedicated stereo channel capture devices, you can capture and stream audio in stereo.
