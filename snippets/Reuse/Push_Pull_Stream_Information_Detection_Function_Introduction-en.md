ZEGOCLOUDâ€™s SDKs provide the ability to monitor the streaming quality, user status, video resolution, and status of the streams forwarded to the CDN (Content Delivery Network), set up the callback for the first frame, and receive the SEI (Supplemental Enhancement Information) during stream publishing and stream playing.
After stream publishing or stream playing is started, the SDK triggers the corresponding s callback, and client applications can obtain real-time streaming data by listening for these callbacks.

Basic concepts:
- Stream publishing: The process of the client app capturing and transmitting audio and video streams to the ZEGOCLOUD Real-Time Audio and Video Cloud.
- Stream playing: The process of the client app receiving and playing audio and video streams from the ZEGOCLOUD Real-Time Audio and Video Cloud.
