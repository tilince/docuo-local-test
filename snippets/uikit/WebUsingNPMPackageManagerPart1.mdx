## Prepare the environment

## Install the SDK

```shell
npm i @zegocloud/zego-uikit-prebuilt --save
```


## Initialize the SDK


1. First, you'll need to generate a [Kit Token](../04-authentication-and-kit-token.mdx). 

    <Note title="Note">
    You can **skip generate Kit Token** if you wanna speed up your integration testing. Remember to generate the Kit Token by referring to [this](../04-authentication-and-kit-token.mdx) when you plan to make your app go live officially.
    </Note>

2. Then, replace the `appID` and `serverSecret` parameters in the following code with your project's AppID and ServerSecret that you get from [Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/project).
