[ZEGOCLOUD's Live Streaming\|_blank](https://www.zegocloud.com/product/live-streaming) is a service that helps you build the most full-featured live streaming experience into web and mobile applications. You can extend the SDK with a bunch of features, such as screen sharing, recording, or upgrading using an add-on to quickly integrate virtual avatars, instant messaging, and more.

Live Streaming allows much more fine-grained control over what's to be built, custom audio and video pre & post-processing, virtual stereo, 10K concurrent speakers, and way more for you to build your interactive video experiences as wanted.
