# Using HTML script

This doc works in almost any programming language and frameworks, and supports both PC and mobile browsers (including WebViews).

The Video Conference Kit SDK is written in pure JavaScript and natively supported by Web browsers, so you can refer to this doc if you're using JQuery, PHP, or JSP.

## Prepare the environment

<Content/>

## Getting started

1. First, you'll need to generate a [Kit Token](../04-authentication-and-kit-token.mdx). 

    <Note title="Note">
    You can **skip generate Kit Token** if you wanna speed up your integration testing. Remember to generate the Kit Token by referring to [this](../04-authentication-and-kit-token.mdx) when you plan to make your app go live officially.
    </Note>


2. Then, replace the `appID` and `serverSecret` parameters in the following code with your project's AppID and ServerSecret that you get from [Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/project). 

    <Note title="Note">
    - `userID` and `roomID` can only contain numbers, letters, and underlines (_). 
    - Users that join the call with the same `roomID` can talk to each other. 
    </Note>
