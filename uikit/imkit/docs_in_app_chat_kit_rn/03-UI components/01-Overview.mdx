# Overview

UI components are basic units of the In-app Chat Kit SDK. You can embed required components to corresponding UI pages based on business requirements. Components receive data from the instance of In-app Chat Kit SDK, send data to the ZEGOCLOUD server, and maintain their business logic.

## UI Components 

Now, we support the following UI components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  
  <Card title="Conversation component" href="./02-Conversation component.mdx">
    It provides the chat list and chat features.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Message component" href="./03-Message component.mdx">
    It provides the message list and message transmission features.
  </Card>

</CardGroup>
