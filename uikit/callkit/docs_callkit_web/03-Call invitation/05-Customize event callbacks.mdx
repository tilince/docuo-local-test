# Customize event callbacks

- - -

## Introduction

If the [Customize the UI for call invitation](./02-Customize%20the%20UI%20for%20call%20invitation.mdx) and [Customize logic hooks](./04-Customize%20call%20invitation%20config.mdx) documents can't meet your needs to do further customization, we also provide some event callbacks for you.

The event callbacks we provided:

```javascript
zp.setCallInvitationConfig({
  // The callee will receive the notification through this callback when receiving a call invitation.
  onIncomingCallReceived: (callID, caller, callType, callees) => {},

  // The callee will receive the notification through this callback when the caller canceled the call invitation.  
  onIncomingCallCanceled: (callID, caller) => {},

  // The caller will receive the notification through this callback when the callee accepts the call invitation. 
  onOutgoingCallAccepted: (callID, callee) => {},

  // The caller will receive the notification through this callback when the callee is on a call.
  onOutgoingCallRejected: (callID, callee) => {},

  // The caller will receive the notification through this callback when the callee declines the call invitation. 
  onOutgoingCallDeclined: (callID, callee) => {},

  // The callee will receive the notification through this callback when he didn't respond to the call invitation. 
  onIncomingCallTimeout: (callID, caller) => {},
  
  // The caller will receive the notification through this callback when the call invitation timed out.
  onOutgoingCallTimeout: (callID, callees) => {},

  // When the callee user clicks the accept button on the call invitation popup, the callee will receive this callback.
  onIncomingCallAcceptButtonPressed: () => {},

  // When the callee user clicks the decline button on the call invitation popup, the callee will receive this callback.
  onIncomingCallDeclineButtonPressed: () => {}
})
```
