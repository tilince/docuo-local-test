# Implement an audio-only session

## Introduction

In ZEGOCLOUD UIKits, the audio and video call features are enabled by default. And you can customize an audio-only session by disabling the video feature as needed. This guide shows how to implement an audio-only session.

It will look like this after the video feature is disabled:

## How do I implement an audio-only session?

To disable the video and make an audio-only session, you just need to complete configuring the following:

- Set the `turnOnCameraWhenJoining` to `false` to turn off the camera. 
- Set the `showMyCameraToggleButton` to `false` to hide the toggle button for enabling/disabling the camera.  
- Set the `showAudioVideoSettingsButton` to `false` to hide the advanced setting button for audio and video. 
- Set the `showScreenSharingButton` to `false` to hide the screen sharing button. 

```javascript
// ....
zp.joinRoom({
     // ...,
    turnOnCameraWhenJoining: false,
    showMyCameraToggleButton: false,
    showAudioVideoSettingsButton: false,
    showScreenSharingButton: false; 
     // ...
});
```
