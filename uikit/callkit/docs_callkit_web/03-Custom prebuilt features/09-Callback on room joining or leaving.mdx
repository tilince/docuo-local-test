# Callbacks on room joining or leaving

## Introduction

ZEGOCLOUD UIKits allows you to set up and configure some function parameters for UIKits to trigger various events according to lifetime.

For example, you might want the timer to start when the room host joins the room and end when the host leaves.


**How do I listen for the callbacks on room joining/leaving?**


- To listen for the callback for room joining, set up the `onJoinRoom` to be a function that takes all the users in the room (an array) as a parameter.
- To listen for the callback for room leaving, set up the `onLeaveRoom` to be a function that takes all the users in the room (an array) as a parameter.


```javascript
// ....
zp.joinRoom({
     // ...,
     onJoinRoom: () => {
        // Add your custom logic
     },
     onLeaveRoom: () => {
       // Add your custom logic
     }
     // ...
});
```
