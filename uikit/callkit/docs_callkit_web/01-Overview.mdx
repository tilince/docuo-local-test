## When do you need the Call Kit


If you want to integrate one-on-one or group voice/video calls ASAP and consider speed or efficiency as the first priority, then the Call Kit is your best choice: 
> 1. Adaptive to PCs and mobile devices, and handles complex network and device exceptions in a standard way, with no more complex concepts to be learned and understood.
> 2. In-call features and UI effects can be customized by modifying parameters as needed.


If you want to highly customize your UI for more advanced use cases, you can make your customization based on the provided [Call Kit open source code](https://github.com/ZEGOCLOUD/zego_uikit_prebuilt_web).
