# Custom prebuilt features

**Call Kit (ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCall)** provides a set of default behaviors and styles. If those don't fully meet your needs, we allow you to flexibly do further customization or add your custom business logic.

After [getting started](../02-Quick%20start.mdx), you may notice there is a `ZegoUIKitPrebuiltCallConfig` when you integrate the Call Kit, and this is exactly used for custom configuration.

#### Now, we support the following:
