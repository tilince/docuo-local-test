# Integrate Minigame


## Principle of integrating MiniGame with Flutter

Our Flutter MiniGame Solution is based on [MiniGame Web JS SDK](https://www.zegocloud.com/docs/game-engine/implement-mini-game?platform=web&language=javascript). The Flutter solution relies on the flutter_inappwebview plugin to achieve interaction with JS and HTML. 

Our demo has currently completed the basic integration process examples, including HTML coding, Dart and HTML interaction encapsulation, etc. If you need to implement more game features, you will need to refer to the implementation method in the demo and expand it yourself. This may require you to read the demo code to understand the interaction between JS, HTML, and Dart.

## Download demo and test it.

1. Before starting, please contact technical support to enable the mini-game service.
2. Download Demo: [Client Demo](https://github.com/ZEGOCLOUD/zego_uikit_prebuilt_live_streaming_example_flutter/tree/master/live_streaming_with_minigame), [Server Demo](https://storage.zego.im/ZegoMiniGameSDK/server/ZegoMiniGameServerDemo.zip). 
3. Modify The Authentication Information: Please replace the appid, appsign, and server secret in Client Demo and Server Demo with those of your project.
4. Running the Server Demo,  then replace the Client Demo's miniGameHostUrl with your own server url.
5. Then you can test ClientDemo (there are multiple demos in the Client Demo repository, please use live_streaming_with_minigame project).

## Integrated into your project

1. Copy the `./assets/minigame` and `./lib/minigame` folders from the Demo to your project.

    </Frame>


2. Declare the newly added assets in your project's `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
assets:
  - assets/minigame/index.js
  - assets/minigame/index.html
```

3. Execute the following command to add the following dependency libraries.


```bash
flutter pub add flutter_inappwebview dio encrypt
```

## Usage Instructions

### initialize the `ZegoMiniGame` SDK and render the mini-game UI.

After integrating `flutter_inappwebview`, you can use `InAppWebView` to render the mini-game UI and initialize the `ZegoMiniGame`. You can use `InAppWebView` anywhere you need it.

<Note title="Note">

In the demo, we render the game as a full-screen game. You can adjust the size of the `InAppWebView` as you like to achieve different display effects, such as a half-screen game.

</Note>


You can refer to [this part of the code](https://github.com/ZEGOCLOUD/zego_uikit_prebuilt_live_streaming_example_flutter/blob/master/live_streaming_with_minigame/lib/main.dart)


Please note that:

1. You need to call `ZegoMiniGame().initWebViewController(controller)` in the `onWebViewCreated` of `InAppWebView`.
2. You need to call `YourGameServer().getToken` and `ZegoMiniGame().initGameSDK()` in the `onWebViewCreated` of `InAppWebView`.

With these two steps, you can complete the initialization of `ZegoMiniGame` SDK.

### Uninit the ZegoMiniGame SDK

When you no longer need the ZegoMiniGame SDK, you need to use `WillPopScope` to destroy the ZegoMiniGame SDK before exiting the page.

> Notice: This portion of code should not be placed in the `dispose` of widget. Because destroying the `ZegoMiniGame` SDK depends on `InAppWebView`, and when the widget is disposed, `InAppWebView` has already been destroyed.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return PopScope(
    onPopInvoked: (bool didPop) async {
      if(didPop){
        await ZegoMiniGame().unloadGame();
        await ZegoMiniGame().uninitGameSDK();
        await ZegoMiniGame().uninitWebViewController();
      }
    },
    child: YourPage(),
  );
}
```



### Get game list

After ensuring the initialization of `ZegoMiniGame`, you can use `ZegoMiniGame().getAllGameList()` to get the game list and render it in the UI.


> You can check the complete demo code for this part [here](https://github.com/ZEGOCLOUD/zego_uikit_prebuilt_live_streaming_example_flutter/blob/master/live_streaming_with_minigame/lib/minigame/ui/show_game_list_view.dart#L32).

```dart
Future<dynamic> showGameListView(BuildContext context, String userID) {
  return showModalBottomSheet(context: context,
    builder: (context) {
      return SingleChildScrollView(
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.white,
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(5),
          child: Column(
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
            children: [
              const Text('GameList', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22, fontWeight: FontWeight.w600)),
              const SizedBox(height: 5),
              ValueListenableBuilder(
                // Get Game List
                valueListenable: ZegoMiniGame().getAllGameList(),
                builder: (BuildContext context, List<dynamic> gameList, Widget? child) {
                  // RENDER THE GAME LIST HERE
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```




### Exchange Currency


<Accordion title="According to the different types of games, this step may be optional or mandatory. Please contact technical support for more details." defaultOpen="false">

Before starting the game:

1. You need to use `YourGameServer().exchangeUserCurrency` to exchange game coins for the user.
2. And use `YourGameServer().getUserCurrency` to query the current amount of game coins for the user.


Demo will call these two methods every time it enters the game, please refer to [here](https://github.com/ZEGOCLOUD/zego_uikit_prebuilt_live_streaming_example_flutter/blob/master/live_streaming_with_minigame/lib/live_streaming_page.dart#L131). You need to adjust the specific logic of `Currency` according to your own needs.

</Accordion>


### Start the game

After obtaining the game list, you can load the game by using `ZegoMiniGame().loadGame()`.

```dart
final loadGameResult = await ZegoMiniGame().loadGame(
  gameID: gameID,
  gameMode: ZegoGameMode.fullScreen,
  loadGameConfig: ZegoLoadGameConfig(minGameCoin: 100),
);
debugPrint('[APP]loadGameResult: $loadGameResult');
Navigator.pop(context, gameID);
```

### Stop the game

`unloadGame` is used to quit the game.

```dart
await ZegoMiniGame().unloadGame();
```
