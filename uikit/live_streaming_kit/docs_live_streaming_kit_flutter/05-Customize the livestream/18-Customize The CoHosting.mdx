# Customize The CoHosting


## APIs

With the following APIs, you can customize your own live streaming co-host logic. 

These interfaces are called through **ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveStreamingController().coHost.function**:

### audience
  - Future `audienceSendCoHostRequest`(\{
    bool **withToast** = false,
  \}) async: 

    audience requests to become a co-host by sending a request to the host. 

    if you want audience be co-host without request to the host, use `startCoHost`. 

    if **withToast** is set to true, a toast message will be displayed after the request succeeds or fails.

  - Future `audienceCancelCoHostRequest`() async: 

    audience cancels the co-host request to the host.
  
  - Future `startCoHost`() async: 

    audience switch to be an co-host directly, without request to host.

    if you want audience be co-host with request to the host, use `audienceSendCoHostRequest`

  - Future `audienceAgreeCoHostInvitation`(\{
    bool **withToast** = false,
  \}) async:
    
    Audience accepts host's invitation to connect be a co-host.

  - Future `audienceRejectCoHostInvitation`() async:
    
    Audience declines host's invitation to connect be a co-host.


### host
  - Future `hostAgreeCoHostRequest`(ZegoUIKitUser **audience**) async:

    host approve the co-host request made by **audience**.

  - Future `hostRejectCoHostRequest`(ZegoUIKitUser **audience**) async: 

    host reject the co-host request made by **audience**.

  - Future `removeCoHost`(ZegoUIKitUser **coHost**) async:

    host remove the co-host, make **coHost** to be a audience

  - Future `hostSendCoHostInvitationToAudience `(
    ZegoUIKitUser **audience**, \{
    bool **withToast** = false,
  \}) async:

    host invite **audience** to be a co-host.

    if **withToast** is set to true, a toast message will be displayed after the request succeeds or fails.

  - `onRequestCoHostEvent`: Notification that an audience has requested to become a co-host to the host.

  - `onCancelCoHostEvent`: Notification that an audience has cancelled their co-host request.

  - `onRequestCoHostTimeoutEvent`: Notification that an audience co-host request has timed out.

### co-host
  - Future `stopCoHost`(\{
    bool **showRequestDialog** = true,
  \}) async:

    co-host ends the connection and switches to the audience role voluntarily.

    if **showRequestDialog** is true, a confirmation dialog will be displayed to prevent accidental clicks.

  
## Events

Through the following callbacks, you can receive notifications about the state changes during the co-hosting process, allowing you to further customize your own logic.

These callbacks are thrown through **ZegoLiveStreamingCoHostEvents**, and you can register these callbacks in **ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveStreaming.events.coHost**.

```dart
ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveStreaming(
  events: ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveStreamingEvents(
    coHost: ZegoLiveStreamingCoHostEvents(
      onUpdated: (coHosts) {
        
      },
      onMaxCountReached: (count){
        
      },
      host: ZegoLiveStreamingCoHostHostEvents(
        
      ),
      audience: ZegoLiveStreamingCoHostAudienceEvents(
        
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

  - `Function(List<ZegoUIKitUser> coHosts)? onUpdated`: 
  
      co-host updated, refers to the event where there is a change in the co-hosts.
      this can occur when a new co-host joins the session or when an existing co-host leaves the session.

### host

  - `Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience)? onRequestReceived`: receive a request that audience request to become a co-host

  - `Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience)? onRequestCanceled`: audience cancelled the co-host request.

  - `Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience)? onRequestTimeout`: the audience's co-host request has timed out.

  - `Function()? onActionAcceptRequest`: host accept the audience's co-host request.

  - `Function()? onActionRefuseRequest`: host refuse the audience's co-host request.

  - `Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience)? onInvitationSent`: host sent invitation to become a co-host to the audience.

  - `Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience)? onInvitationTimeout`: the host's co-host invitation has timed out.

  - `void Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience)? onInvitationAccepted`: 

  - `void Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience)? onInvitationRefused`: audience refused to a co-host request from host
  
### audience

  - `Function()? onRequestSent`: audience requested to become a co-host to the host.

  - `Function()? onActionCancelRequest`: audience cancelled the co-host request.

  - `Function()? onRequestTimeout`: the audience's co-host request has timed out.

  - `Function()? onRequestAccepted`: host accept the audience's co-host request.

  - `Function()? onRequestRefused`: host refuse the audience's co-host request.

  - `void Function(ZegoUIKitUser host)? onInvitationReceived`: received a co-host invitation from the host.
  
  - `Function()? onInvitationTimeout`: the host's co-host invitation has timed out.

  - `Function()? onActionAcceptInvitation`: audience refuse co-host invitation from the host.

  - `Function()? onActionRefuseInvitation`: audience refuse co-host invitation from the host.
