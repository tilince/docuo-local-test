# Set live streaming mode

## Introduction

In the Live Streaming Kit, we provide 3 audience modes for live streaming:

- **Real-time Live**: A real-time live streaming service that enables **millions of audiences** to watch live streaming simultaneously at a latency of less than **300 ms**.

    Best for scenarios where: Require stable and smooth voice and video experience even under weak network conditions. And the host, co-host, and audience need to interact frequently, that is, achieving a high level of high-quality and highly interactive live streaming.


- **Interactive Live Streaming**: An interactive low-latency live streaming service that keeps **millions of audiences** engaged simultaneously at low latency (**600 ms - 1 s**). 
    
    Best for scenarios where: The host and audience need to interact during a live stream, that is, achieving a certain level of interactivity while maintaining cost efficiency.


- **Live Streaming**: A high-concurrency live streaming service that allows **tens of millions of audiences** to enjoy live streaming at a low latency (**1 s - 3 s**). 
    
    Best for scenarios where: The app scenarios don't require high interactions, such as single-hosting live streaming, live sports streaming, and TV channels live streaming.


<Note title="Note">

- Real-Time Live is activated by default. 
- Live Streaming and Interactive Live Streaming require you a manual activation on [Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/project).
