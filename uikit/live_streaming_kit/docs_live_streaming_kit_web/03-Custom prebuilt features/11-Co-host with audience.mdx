# Co-host with audience


## Introduction

During live streaming, in order to increase interactivity, the host and audience can interact with each other in real time through audio and video by connecting via "co-hosting". The host can actively invite the audience to become co-hosts, or let the audience apply to become co-hosts on their own. 

This doc will introduce how to configure this feature.

## Implementation steps

### Import the ZIM plugin

- **Using the NPM:**

1. Install the plug-in.
    ```js
    npm i @zegocloud/zego-uikit-prebuilt zego-zim-web --save 
    ```

2. Import the Live Streaming Kit in your project's `js` or `ts` file:

    ```js
    import { ZIM } from "zego-zim-web";
    import { ZegoUIKitPrebuilt } from '@zegocloud/zego-uikit-prebuilt';
    ```

- **Using the HTML Script Tag:**

    Import the following script code in the `HTML` page.

    (**A more recommended way**: Download and save it on your app server, and import it to the corresponding path.
    ```html
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/zego-zim-web/index.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@zegocloud/zego-uikit-prebuilt/zego-uikit-prebuilt.js"></script>
    ```


### Configure parameters

```js
const zp = ZegoUIKitPrebuilt.create(TOKEN);
zp.addPlugins({ ZIM });
zp.joinRoom({
    //...other params
    showMakeCohostButton: true, // Whether to show the button that is used to invite the audience to co-host on the host end. 
    showRemoveCohostButton: true, // Whether to show the button that is used to remove the audience on the host end.
    showRequestToCohostButton: true, // Whether to show the button that is used to request to co-host on the audience end.
})
```
