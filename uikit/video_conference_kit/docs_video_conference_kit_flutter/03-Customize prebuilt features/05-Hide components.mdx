## Hide the components on the user view

By default, the Video Conference Kit (ZegoUIKitPrebuiltVideoConference) displays `UserNameLabel` and `MicrophoneStateIcon` floating above the view. If these components are not needed, you can hide them using the following three configurations in `audioVideoViewConfig`.

- `showMicrophoneStateOnView`: whether to display the microphone state on the view. Displayed by default.
- `showCameraStateOnView`: Whether to display the camera state on the view. Not displayed by default.
- `showUserNameOnView`: Indicates whether to display the username on the view. Displayed by default. 

## Hide the conference leave notifications

By default, the conference join/leave notifications and new message notifications are displayed on the left corner notification area. Among these, the conference leave notifications can be hidden by configuring the `notificationViewConfig.notifyUserLeave` from `true` to `false`.


## Hide the device state on the member list

By default, the camera state and microphone state are displayed by default on the member list. To hide them, use the `showMicrophoneState` and `showCameraState` in the `memberListConfig`.


## Hide sound waves and user avatars


As shown in the rendering, the Video Conference Kit (ZegoUIKitPrebuiltVideoConference) displays the user's avatar and sound waves when the camera is turned off.
If you are not satisfied with the user avatars and sound wave style, you can hide them using the following two configurations in `audioVideoViewConfig`:

- `showAvatarInAudioMode`: Whether to display the user avatars in audio mode. Displayed by default.
- `showSoundWavesInAudioMode`: In audio mode, whether to display the sound waves around the user avatar in audio mode. Displayed by default.
