## Hide the components on the user view

By default, the Video Conference Kit (ZegoUIKitPrebuiltVideoConference) displays `UserNameLabel` and `MicrophoneStateIcon` floating above the view. If these components are not needed, you can hide them using the following three configurations in `audioVideoViewConfig`.

1. `showMicrophoneStateOnView`: Whether to display the microphone state on the view. Displayed by default.
2. `showCameraStateOnView`: Whether to display the camera state on the view. Not displayed by default.
3. `showUserNameOnView`: Indicates whether to display the username on the view. Displayed by default. 
4. `showSoundWavesInAudioMode`: In audio mode, whether to display the sound waves around the user avatar in audio mode. Displayed by default. 


## Hide the conference leave notifications

By default, the conference join/leave notifications and new message notifications are displayed on the left corner notification area. Among these, the conference leave notifications can be hidden by configuring the `notificationViewConfig.notifyUserLeave` from `true` to `false`.


## Hide the device state on the member list

By default, the camera state and microphone state are displayed by default on the member list. To hide them, use the `showMicrophoneState` and `showCameraState` in the `memberListConfig`.
