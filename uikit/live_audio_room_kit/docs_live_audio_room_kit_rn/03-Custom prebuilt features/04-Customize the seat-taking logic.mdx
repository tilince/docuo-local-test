# Customize the seat-taking logic

## Customize your own business logic

Live Audio Room Kit (ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveAudioRoom) enables you to customize your own business logic via the `ref` attribute of the component provided.

The following are supported by the `function call`:

<Note title="Note">
All these methods are asynchronous and will return a `Promise` object.
</Note>

- `takeSeat`: Take a speaker seat,
- `leaveSeat`: Voluntarily leave a seat.
- `removeSpeakerFromSeat`(userID: string): Remove the speaker from the seat.
- `closeSeats`: Close an open speaker seat, once it is closed, the audience can only take the seat by inviting by the host or sending a seat-taking request.
- `openSeats`: Open a closed seat, once it is opened, the audience can take the seat by clicking it.
- `applyToTakeSeat`(seatIndex: number): The audience applies to take a speaker seat.
- `cancelSeatTakingRequest`: The audience cancels his seat-taking request.
- `acceptSeatTakingRequest`(audienceUserID: string): The host accepts the audience's seat-taking request.
- `rejectSeatTakingRequest`(audienceUserID: string): The host rejects the audience's seat-taking request.
- `inviteAudienceToTakeSeat`(userID:string): The host invites the audience to take a speaker seat.
- `acceptHostTakeSeatInvitation`: The audience accepts the seat-taking invite from the host.
- `turnMicrophoneOn`: Turn on the user's microphone.

The following are supported by the `event callbacks`:

<Note title="Note">
The `onSeatClicked` and `onMemberListMoreButtonPressed` overrides Live Audio Room Kit's prebuilt logic, meaning that when you customize these events, the prebuilt events are no longer executed.
</Note>

- `onMemberListMoreButtonPressed`(user: ZegoUIKitUser): This callback will be triggered when the more button in the member list is pressed. 
- `onSeatClicked`(index: number, user: ZegoUIKitUser): This callback will be triggered when a seat is clicked. 
- `onSeatsClosed`: This callback will be triggered when a speaker seat is closed. 
- `onSeatsOpened`: This callback will be triggered when a closed speaker seat is opened. 
- `onSeatsChanged`(takenSeats: &lcub; index: number; user: ZegoUIKitUser &rcub;[], untakenSeats: number[]): This callback will be triggered when someone gets on/gets off/switches seat. 
- `onSeatTakingRequested`(audience: ZegoUIKitUser): The host will receive a notification via this callback when the audience applies to take a seat.

- `onSeatTakingRequestCanceled`(audience: ZegoUIKitUser): The host will receive a notification via this callback when the audience cancels his seat-taking request.
- `onSeatTakingInviteRejected`: The host will receive a notification via this callback when the audience rejects the seat-taking invite.  
- `onSeatTakingRequestRejected`: The audience will receive a notification via this callback when his seat-taking request is rejected by the host.
- `onHostSeatTakingInviteSent`: The audience will receive a notification via this callback when the host invites them to take a seat.

## Customize the audience's seat-taking logic

The reference code below implements the following:

1. Decide whether to show the "apply to take a seat" button.

- Listen to the `onSeatsClosed` and `onSeatsOpened`, you can tell whether the seat is open or closed. If open, the button shows. If closed, the button shall be hidden.

2. How to know whether a seat-taking request is sent?

- Listen to the `onSeatTakingRequestFailed` and `onSeatTakingRequestRejected` callbacks, and you can tell when the request is sent successfully via these callbacks.
- Listen to the `takenSeats`in the callback `onSeatsChanged`, you can tell when the audience takes a seat successfully.


3. How to **apply to take a seat** and **cancel the seat-taking request**?

- To send a seat-taking request, use the `applyToTakeSeat` method in the `ref` attribute of `ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveAudioRoom`.
- To cancel the seat-taking request after applying, use the `cancelSeatTakingRequest` method in the `ref` attribute of `ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveAudioRoom`.
- And sure, these methods will return a result, you can do further logic customization based on the returned results.
